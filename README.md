# CookeyLang C++
Welcome to the C++ Implementation of CookeyLang! This is the ideal interpreter we want at the end of our goals.

All the code can be found in `CookeyLangInterpreter` folder (much as visual studio's style), and they are organized into different files.

Happy coding!

## Compiling
Make sure you compile with at least `/std:c++14`. For linux users,
```sh
g++ *.cpp -std=c++14 -o CookeyLangInterpreter
```
